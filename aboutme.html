                    <p>My name is Dagny Hedberg. I chose to write a website about health improvement because health is very important to me. In recent years, I started improving my diet, exercising, and doing yoga, and the way my body feels is a lot better because of it. I strongly encourage anyone who visits my page to take care of your body because it will greatly improve your quality of life.</p>

                    <p>A little more about me: I am a Communication Arts major at UNH Manchester and a teller at St. Mary's Bank in Milford. I enjoy playing the violin, juggling, and listening to music. My favorite band is <a href="http://www.betweentheburiedandme.com">Between the Buried and Me</a>. My passion is travel and I hope to find a career that allows me to see the world.</p>

                    <p>I must give credit to my yoga studio, <a href="http://forever-yoga.com">Forever Yoga</a> in Milford, NH, for encouraging me to practice yoga regularly. The owner Jessica is nice, accommodating, and a great teacher. I highly recommend the studio especially to beginners because she has a variety of classes that will fit anyone's needs.</p>
